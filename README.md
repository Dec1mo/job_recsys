---

<p align="center"> A system that recommends suitable jobs for an user-provided resume (pdf files) and/or profile.
    <br> 
</p>

## TL;DR
In this project, I built an end-to-end job recommend system by using **CV Parser** for transfering a pdf CV file to a json file with some important infomation like: ```studytime```,  ```workingtime```, ```position```, ```experience```, ```address```,... and **Skill Extractor** for extracting a set of skills from a text (such as experiences or job requirements,...). These two components were developed by my colleagues at DSLab - Hanoi University of Science and Technologies and unfortunately, we can't make them and the data used in job_recsys public. Then, I developed **Feature Normalizer** for skills clustering and feature extraction and **Ranking Component** for embedding those features into vector space and matching them to get appropriate results. For more detailed information, please check my [presentation file](https://github.com/Dec1mo/job_recsys/blob/main/docs/ThaiDD_Job_RecSys.pdf).

## Demo <a name = "demo"></a>
I only made a simple two-page flask web app in order to show how job_recsys works.
- At **home page**, a user can upload his/her CV and/or fill some information in the Profile section, then press ```Submit```.

- Top k=3 most suitable job desciptions for that user will appear at **result page**:

### CV Parser
**CV Parser** transfers a pdf CV file to a json file with some important infomation like: ```studytime```,  ```workingtime```, ```position```, ```experience```, ```address```,...

### Skill Extractor
**Skill Extractor** extracts a set of skills from a text (such as experiences or job requirements,...).

</p>

### Feature Normalizer 
**Feature Normalizer** consists of 2 component:
- Skill Clustering uses [Affinity Propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_propagation) for normalizing skills (6760 skills had been normalized to 1002 skills).
- Feature Extraction normalizes other features by using some advanced techniques such as: fuzzy searching, interquartile range; then combines them.

</p>

### Ranking Component
**Ranking Component** consists of 2 component:
- Embedding Component uses TFIDF, LSA or SimilarityEncoding to embed features into vector space.
- Matching Component: computes weighted average of cosine similarity or Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) between user's vector and job description's vector; then ranks them to obtain top k matches.

### Requirements
+ CV Parser API (private)
+ Skill Extractor (private)
+ Data: resumes, job descriptions, skills (private)
+ Others

âš  Warning: Apparently, you don't have the private stuff so you can't make any good recommendations. You can still treat this project as a guideline for building an end-to-end recommentation system. Also, you can turn on the web app and mess with its interface.

### Installing
After cloning this project, you will want to process data and save some pipelines beforehand.
#### Process CV, JD data
```
>> python app/data_process/preprocess.py
```
#### Create ```skill_norm_dict``` for normalizing skills
```
>> python app/data_process/skill_norm.py
```
#### Create some embedding pipelines
```
>> python app/model/embedding.py
```
Everything is prepared.
#### It's time to start the flask web app
```
>> python app/run.py
```
From this moment, job_recsys is ready to recommend ðŸ˜Ž.
